- Iâ€™m currently a student at Swarthmore College and prospect CS major.
- In my free time, I try to improve my programming skills and understanding of CS concepts through short projects!
- Iâ€™m looking for internship opportunities in software/web development to continue growing and use my skills to contribute to those around me!
